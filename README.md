## 🎨 Development Philosophy

```kotlin
class Developer(val name: String = "Sulton") {
    val principles = listOf(
        "Clean, maintainable code over quick hacks",
        "User experience is paramount",
        "Continuous learning and adaptation",
        "Test early, test often",
        "Documentation is love for future developers"
    )
    
    fun approach() = """
        I believe in building applications that are not just functional,
        but delightful to use and easy to maintain. Every line of code
        should serve a purpose, and every feature should solve a real problem.
    """.trimIndent()
